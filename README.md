# WebDesignUsingBootstrapp
this is my first web design using Bootstrap 
The first page demonstrates my expertise in utilizing Bootstrap's pre-built components and grid system to create sleek, 
modern designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
The second page showcases my skills in customizing Bootstrap to create a unique design tailored to project requirements. . 🎨✨
I have also added the screen recording with a demo of the responsiveness of webpages with all devices please checkout.
